    "### Sub analysis of demand forecast accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick analysis to identify if there is a correlation between Portland General Electric (PGE) hourly demand, demand forecast, and daytime mean temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will also determine the accuracy of PGE's demand forecast. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will also serve as a guide for creating API calls on the EIA website. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background: PGE is a major public utility which distributes electricty to 44% of Oregon's inhabitants (including customers in Multnomah county). \n",
    "\n",
    "The year 2021 was selected as Oregon experienced [record temperatures](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/02/10/oregons-2021-heat-dome-notches-another-record/). Some parts of oregon reached 119F. \n",

    "The data for this analysis comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (https://www.eia.gov/opendata/). Data is made available via their public API. "
